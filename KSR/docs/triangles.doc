\section strips Triangle Strips
A Triangle Strip is a series of connected triangles. The first three points define a single triangle. From then on, every point in the strip is combined with the last two points of the last assembled triangle to create a new triangle. This way, the number of required vertices equals the number of triangles + 2. An example of this is shown below.

\section fans Triangle Fans

Similar to Triangle Strips, A Triangle Fan is a series of connected triangles. The first three points define a single triangle. From then on, every point in the strip is combined with the last point of the last assembled triangle and the first point of the first triangle. This way, the triangles form around the first point in a "fan" shape. The number of required vertices equals the number of triangles + 2. Some examples are given below.
